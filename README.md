# Introduction

<div class="introduction" align="justify">
This project was developed as part of my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering, where I was tasked with creating a game using a programming language of my choice. I completed the project in Python, opting for its readability, smooth learning curve, and great practicality—characteristics that are essential for fast and efficient development.

I chose to create a version of the classic Hangman game because I believe it provides an excellent opportunity to test and apply a variety of programming concepts. Moreover, the game is a fun and engaging way to explore logical reasoning and problem-solving, making it an ideal choice for this type of academic exercise.

In the game, the user is invited to choose a specific theme, such as Movies & TV Shows, Video Games, Car Brands, among others. After selecting the theme, the system randomly generates a word related to that theme, which the player must attempt to guess one letter at a time while being penalized for each mistake made. The challenge is to win the game before reaching the maximum number of attempts, which results in the character's "hang" in the game.

The implementation involved creating a data structure to store the words for each theme, randomly generating those words, and interacting with the user dynamically, providing constant feedback on the progress of the game. The simplicity of the Hangman game, therefore, provided an ideal scenario to apply programming concepts such as loops, functions, conditionals, and string manipulation, as well as an opportunity to explore user interaction in a practical and enjoyable way.

# Guide to Download and Install Python on Your PC
<div>
  
This guide will help you download and install Python on your computer to start coding. Follow these steps carefully!

## **Step 1: Visit the Official Python Website**
1. Open your web browser.
2. Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).

---

## **Step 2: Download the Latest Version**
1. On the homepage, you’ll see a button labeled **"Download Python X.X.X"** (where X.X.X is the latest version).
2. Click the button to download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

---

## **Step 3: Install Python**

### **Windows**
1. Open the downloaded file (`python-X.X.X.exe`).
2. On the first screen, check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.
3. Click **"Install Now"** for a default installation or **"Customize installation"** to modify settings.

### **macOS**
1. Open the downloaded file (`python-X.X.X.pkg`).
2. Follow the installation wizard.
3. After installation, Python will be accessible through the Terminal.

### **Linux**
1. Check if Python is already installed by running:
   ```
   python3 --version
   ```

2. If it’s not installed, use your package manager to install it. For example, on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

## Step 4: Verify the Installation
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux).
2. Run the following command:
```
python --version
```
or
```
python3 --version
```
3. You should see the installed Python version displayed.

## Step 5: Set Up a Code Editor
While Python comes with a basic editor called IDLE, you might want to use a more advanced code editor:

- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

Download and install the editor of your choice.
