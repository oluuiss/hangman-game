# Introduction

<div class="introduction" align="justify">
This project was developed as part of my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering, where I was tasked with creating a game using a programming language of my choice. I completed the project in Python, opting for its readability, smooth learning curve, and great practicalityâ€”characteristics that are essential for fast and efficient development.

I chose to create a version of the classic Hangman game because I believe it provides an excellent opportunity to test and apply a variety of programming concepts. Moreover, the game is a fun and engaging way to explore logical reasoning and problem-solving, making it an ideal choice for this type of academic exercise.

In the game, the user is invited to choose a specific theme, such as Movies & TV Shows, Video Games, Car Brands, among others. After selecting the theme, the system randomly generates a word related to that theme, which the player must attempt to guess one letter at a time while being penalized for each mistake made. The challenge is to win the game before reaching the maximum number of attempts, which results in the character's "hang" in the game.

The implementation involved creating a data structure to store the words for each theme, randomly generating those words, and interacting with the user dynamically, providing constant feedback on the progress of the game. The simplicity of the Hangman game, therefore, provided an ideal scenario to apply programming concepts such as loops, functions, conditionals, and string manipulation, as well as an opportunity to explore user interaction in a practical and enjoyable way.

# Guide to Download and Install Python on Your PC
<div>
  
To start programming in Python and code your Hangman game or any other project, follow the steps below to download and install Python on your computer.

## Step 1: Access the Official Python Website
1. Open your web browser.
2. Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).

## Step 2: Download the Python Installer
1. On the homepage of the website, you will see a button to download the latest version of Python.
   - If you're using Windows, the website will automatically suggest the correct installer for your system.
   - If you're using Mac or Linux, the site will also provide the appropriate installer for those systems.

2. Click the **"Download Python"** button (e.g., **Download Python 3.x.x**).

## Step 3: Start the Installation Process
1. After the download is complete, locate the installer file on your computer (usually in the **Downloads** folder).
2. Double-click the file to start the installation process.

## Step 4: Installation Setup
1. **Important:** When the installer starts, **make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"** before clicking **"Install Now"**. This will ensure that Python is correctly set up on your system and accessible from the command prompt.

2. Click **"Install Now"**. The installer will copy the necessary files to your computer and set up Python.

## Step 5: Verify the Installation
1. Once the installation is complete, open the **Command Prompt** (on Windows) or **Terminal** (on Mac or Linux).

2. Type the following command and press **Enter**:
```
python --version
```

```
python3 --version
```
